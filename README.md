description coming soon

"filePath" should be ignored for now,
dont add the actual song files here because we need the whole project < 5gb for now,
site-wide css should go in "base.css" and any specific things should go in their own file such as "gallery.css" for css on the gallery page or for gallery elements

when adding images to mr-kitty updates, name them after the date posted. if that name is already taken then append .1 to the end,
the structure is as follows:
***Title*** **Date** $$Message$$ !!image name if needed!!

^ view raw file for this, github formats it

updates are also not sorted by date, place them in the file where it belongs (most recent at the top).
also use GMT time 🙏
