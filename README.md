description coming soon


"filePath" should be ignored for now
dont add the actual song files here, we need the whole project < 2gb for now
site-wide css should go in "base.css", any specific things should go in their own file such as "gallery.css" for css on the gallery page or for gallery elements
feel free to tidy up the code, sorry its such a mess ðŸ˜­
